"""
Game-Theoretic Weight Analysis Module

This module implements novel game-theoretic approaches for analyzing neural network
weight interactions and discovering critical configurations through strategic modeling.

Key Components:
- NeuroGameAnalyzer: Strategic modeling of neuron interactions
- GameTheoreticWeightAnalyzer: Nash equilibrium weight analysis
- CooperativeGameAnalyzer: Cooperative vs adversarial dynamics
- EvolutionaryStabilityAnalyzer: Long-term vulnerability prediction
